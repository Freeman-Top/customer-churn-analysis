C. Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL Report

1. Introduction and Dataset Setup:

This report presents a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer churn behavior in a telecommunications company. The dataset was initially provided in CSV format under the file name customer_churn_telecom_services.csv. To facilitate structured querying and efficient analysis, the data was imported into Azure Data Studio, which was used in conjunction with a SQL Server database environment.

Dataset Import and Preparation:
A dedicated database, Customer_Churn_Analysis, was created to host the project data.

The dataset was imported using Azure Data Studio’s Import Wizard, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration.

The resulting table, named CustomerChurnn, was structured with proper data type assignments across numerical, categorical, and textual fields.

Comprehensive data integrity checks were conducted to confirm record count, column consistency, and appropriate value distributions.

Key fields such as Churn, CustomerID, and Contract were indexed to optimize query performance.

No data import issues or missing values were identified at this stage.

2. Overview of Customer Churn:

An initial high-level assessment was conducted to understand the scale of churn within the customer base.

Total Customers Analyzed: 7,043

Customers Who Churned: 1,869

Overall Churn Rate: 26.54%

This churn rate suggests that approximately one in four customers has discontinued their service—an indication of a significant business concern requiring strategic attention.

3. Demographic Analysis:

Gender Distribution and Churn:

The customer base is fairly balanced in terms of gender.

Churn rates are nearly identical between male and female customers, both approximating 26%.

This suggests that gender does not play a significant role in predicting churn.

Senior Citizens:

Senior citizens (defined in the dataset as individuals with a value of 1 under the SeniorCitizen column) exhibit a churn rate of approximately 42%.

In contrast, non-senior customers show a churn rate closer to 24%.

This difference indicates that age is a strong factor and that senior customers may benefit from improved engagement or specialized service options.

4. Analysis of Contract Types and Subscription Preferences:

Contract Length:
Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate, reaching nearly 60%.

By comparison, those on one-year or two-year contracts experience significantly lower churn, with the latter maintaining churn rates below 20%.

These findings highlight the stabilizing influence of long-term contractual commitments on customer retention.

Internet Service Type:
Users of fiber optic internet report a churn rate of 41.89%, which is more than double that of DSL users (18.96%).

This suggests a potential gap in value perception or service satisfaction among fiber optic customers, possibly related to pricing or performance expectations.

5. Billing and Pricing Behavior:

Monthly Charges:
The average monthly charge across customers is approximately $64.

Customers paying more than $80 per month are far more likely to churn, with churn rates reaching approximately 40%.

In contrast, customers with monthly charges below $40 have churn rates under 10%, underscoring the price sensitivity within the customer base.

Payment Method:
Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn rate at 45%, while those paying via automatic credit card payments experience significantly lower churn (approximately 15%).

This pattern suggests that customers who rely on manual billing methods may be less engaged or more likely to reconsider their service.

6. Tenure-Based Churn Trends:

Churn is particularly pronounced in the first 20 months of a customer’s tenure, peaking around 6%.

After the 60-month mark, churn drops to below 2%, indicating increased loyalty among long-standing customers.

Many churned customers exhibit a pattern of low total charges but high monthly charges, which points to early termination due to dissatisfaction or affordability concerns.

7. Household Characteristics and Churn:

Customers without partners or dependents display higher churn rates, around 33%.

Those with family connections show notably lower churn, suggesting that household stability may contribute positively to customer retention.

8. Churn-Prone Customer Profile:

Based on the analysis, the segment most vulnerable to churn tends to have the following characteristics:

Contract Type: Month-to-month

Internet Service: Fiber optic

Payment Method: Electronic check

Tenure: Less than 20 months

Monthly Charges: Greater than $80

This group represents a high-risk cluster that should be prioritized for retention strategies and targeted interventions.

Conclusion:

This comprehensive SQL EDA analysis reveals critical patterns in customer churn behavior. The findings highlight specific customer segments that require immediate attention and provide actionable insights for developing targeted retention strategies. The high churn rate of 26.5% represents a significant business challenge, but the analysis identifies clear opportunities for intervention, particularly among new customers, fiber optic users, and those on month-to-month contracts.
