---  TARGETED RETENTION STRATEGIES:

-- Immediate Actions (High Impact)
-- Focus on high-churn segments:
-- Fiber optic users â†’ Improve service reliability.
-- Month-to-month contracts â†’ Offer long-term incentives.
-- Electronic check payers â†’ Push auto-pay discounts.

-- Family plan discounts to reduce attrition.

-- CONCLUSION

-- Key Takeaways:
-- Fiber, month-to-month contracts, and electronic check users are highest risk.
-- Senior citizens and high-spenders need special attention.
