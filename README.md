## 📚 Conclusion
This customer churn analysis project provided end-to-end insights by combining exploratory SQL queries, Power BI visualizations, and machine learning techniques. Key churn drivers were identified across customer demographics, service subscriptions, contract types, and billing behaviors.
Through unsupervised learning (K-Means), customer segments were discovered, revealing groups at high churn risk. Supervised models like logistic regression and random forest effectively predicted churn accurately, enabling targeted retention strategies.
Overall, the analysis suggests that improving long-term contracts, bundling services, and encouraging automatic payment methods could significantly reduce customer churn. These findings can guide telecom providers toward data-driven decision-making and customer loyalty improvements.
